/**
 * Subprocess integration test for the SessionStart hook.
 *
 * Spawns the hook exactly the way each agent's settings.json would:
 * `node --disable-warning=ExperimentalWarning --experimental-strip-types
 * session-start.ts` against a synthetic vault. Locks the contracts the
 * unit-level tests can't reach:
 *
 *  - Exit code 0 on a minimal vault (no manifest, no work/active/, no git).
 *  - stderr is silent — proves the warning-suppression flag is wired
 *    correctly on this hook, not just on qmd-refresh.
 *  - stdout contains every required section header, in order, so a
 *    regression that drops a section is caught.
 *  - openTasks emits "(no open tasks)" when work/active/ and the vault
 *    root are empty of user content — covers the post-#83 redesign at
 *    the orchestrator level (the pure-helper tests cover the algorithm).
 *  - openTasks emits a task with source attribution when work/active/
 *    contains one.
 *
 * Runs identically on Windows, macOS, and Linux. QMD's spawnSync inside
 * the hook is a graceful no-op when qmd isn't installed; when it is, the
 * incremental update against a tmp dir is fast and side-effect-free.
